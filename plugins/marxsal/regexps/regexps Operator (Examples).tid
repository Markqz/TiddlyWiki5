!! Find the major categories of configuration tiddlers

Note that we do this by looking for the text between the ``$:/conf/`` prefix and the first subsequent forward slash (``/``):

<<.operator-example 1 "[all[system+shadows]regexps[\$:/config/(.+?)/]unique[]]" "The major categories of configuration tiddlers">>

----
!! Find the first 5 url references from the [[Release 5.1.14]] notes page.

Note that we use the `(?g)` global modifier and that we need to assign our regular expression using the [[Vars Widget|VarsWidget]]. Because this expression is global, grouping is not possible and we use a separate ``removeprefix`` filter to trim the end of each result :

<$macrocall
$name="wikitext-example-without-html"
src="""<$vars ex1="(?g)http.+?\]\]" brackets="]]">
<<list-links "[[Release 5.1.14]regexps:text<ex1>removesuffix<brackets>limit[5]]">>
</$vars>
"""/>

----

!! Using regular expression grouping to split input into multiple text

In this example the first 3 tiddlers tagged as "Resources" are split into their topic and authors. The result is a list of 6 items. Once again, we need to place our regular expression inside a variable in order to get around filter limitations (caused by the internal double quotes) :

<$macrocall
$name="wikitext-example-without-html"
src="""<$vars ex2='"(.+)" by (.*)$'>
<<list-links '[tag[Resources]limit[3]regexps<ex2>]'>>
</$vars>"""/>
