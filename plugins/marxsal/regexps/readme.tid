Installs a filter operator ''regexps'' that takes a set of input titles and then splits them based on a regular expression. This can create brand new titles. See [[regexps]] for more details.

This plugin has been proposed as an [[addition|https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5/pull/2963]] for the TW5 core.
